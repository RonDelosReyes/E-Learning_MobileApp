Capstone Project E-Learning Mobile App

The E-Learning Mobile App is designed for college students to access learning materials such as lessons, quizzes, and Augmented Reality (AR) learning experiences through a mobile platform. The beta phase aims to evaluate the app’s functionality, usability, performance, and overall learning experience before the final release.

**During this phase, testers may encounter**:
  - Incomplete or experimental features
  - Minor bugs or performance issues
  - UI/UX changes based on feedback

**Beta Testing Goals**:
  - Validate core features (lesson viewing, quizzes, AR experience)
  - Identify bugs and usability issues
  - Gather feedback to improve learning engagement
  - Test app stability across different devices

**Feedback & Issues**:
Testers are encouraged to:
  - Report bugs via GitHub Issues
  - Suggest improvements or feature enhancements
  - Share feedback on AR interactions and learning flow
    
Your feedback is highly valuable and will directly contribute to the improvement of this capstone project.
